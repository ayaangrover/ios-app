# ios-app

An iOS app with news from NYT, Guardian, and every single sports news webpage in english. Also has my schedule in a different tab for easy access!
**How to use:** Currently, this app is not on testflight since I don't have a dev subscription(yet). Therefore, you can use it by installing XCode on a mac with an M1 Chip or later. Then download the zip file and extract the contents. Lastly, open XCode and select the folder from the app.
